<div class="poem">
<pre>
you lost the wondrous
simplicity of yourself
in caverns of uncertainty
turning monstrous. no
longer. breathe free,
for I love you. your

site of unspeakability
unlocked, more flexible
than you know, more
tunable than you dared.

when I say I love you
I dare to speak it un-
reserved, no contingency,
no preservation for our
love for self-deprecation.

when I say I love you
our entire timeline of
selves within selves upon
selves reciprocates, when
I say I love you we all

return the favor, our
favor. an ignition, an
engine, a present of
us all; I.
