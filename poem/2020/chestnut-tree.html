<div class="poem">
<pre>
chestnut tree grows becomes
people and place breathes in
winter breathes out summer...

...ashes to people to place
to things and all the way back
to the top and up the ladder,

to fetch the cat stranded
between wind and autumn
birds just out of reach but,

still, chestnut tree, placed just
so on dirt hill within roots up
vines through time not inexorable

not ceaseless any more than
breath, living wind, assumed by
tumbled possession you in aspect.

I love wind for it is breath
and in any moment, all moments.
see? carried, tumbling, form.

<em>November 2020</em>
