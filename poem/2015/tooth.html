I.
The Gargantuans raged, waist deep in the Red Sea, bartering for our freedom.
One knocked the other in the mouth, and teeth rained upon the western shore.

run
just run
  the still-toothed Gargantuan said,
strangling his gap-mouthed rival
and wrestling him into the water.

it seemed a reasonable option
so we did as we were told
(we had gotten good at that)
and fled through a tunnel in the sea.

shit, man
  said Moses, just before our turn came,
a tooth!
we can't
bust out
without
a tooth

so he and aaron and joshua and i made the split sea wait
and combed the beach for teeth.

We found one; six feet four inches tall,
three feet in diameter, heavy enough it took four of us
to heave the fallen white onto our shoulders.

ok yeah
this'll work
let's bounce
  said Moses,
and off we trotted through the quivering waves.

II.
The tooth would have become unbearable much sooner,
but soon as we reached the eastern shore,
its root began to grow,
wrapped around our necks and shoulders,
braced our backs against its weight.

Still, two hours later, we slowed to a walk, and four hours later a crawl
and eight hours after we began our flight, we stopped.

It was no use. There was no water in the rocks,
nor bread set down like dew in morning,
just us, and a tooth, and the desert.

will you help us carry this
  said Moses.

are you
fucking
crazy?
  replied the israelites.

yeah
that's fair
  said Moses.

III.
Three more days of staggering,
and the tooth's roots split like hairs, sharp-edged,
slicing at our shoulders and backs.

man
i dunno, man
  said aaron.

ok guys
  said Moses,
just be cool, guys.
you just gotta
trust me
on this
  and he took the needle-sharp ends of the roots
and slid them into our veins.

The pain was that of revelation.
Organs and nerves screamed greeting to nourishment
as though each of the roots had found each of our nerve endings
and sliced each one once and once only, and then again, altogether.

Roots covered us in a pulsing mass,
pressing against our eyelids and slivering through our ears and nostrils.

i contain fresh water,
  the tooth hummed. hold me.
remind me
who i used to be.

have forty years yet passed? have seven minutes
yet past? six hours unending and israelites followed and
a mass of root curled from the tooth and
they grasped for tendrils and
sucked them dry, stomached filling with plenty after three sips.

IV.
Four pairs of hands slid the tooth from our backs, and we rested.
When we woke our mouths burned and we begged for water,
but all excess nourisment had turned overnight to ash.

The tooth was silent. No manner of coaxing or prayer
could muster a single drop. Its roots had shrunken from the night before,
from a bush covering us four israelites to a whisper exuding from the pulp.

We spat ash from our lungs and waited for the end,
but four other israelites then strode to the tooth, hoisting it onto their backs,
sliding needle-thin slivers of root into their veins.

In this way we proceed. We call it Freshwater
on account of how its drooping roots drip-dropped us freshness,
and rotate its bearers each day.

V.
When the great cycle of our people had turned once more on us four to bear,
we would have weeped, if we had liquid left for tears,
for we knew what kind of sorrow boiled in the severed root of the once-living,
and in the fragments of a Gargantuan undermined.

It took only a dozen days
to feel a change in our teeth. Even unrooted,
rustling past each other for our daily sluice,
we'd chatter ceaselessly of our Freshwater visions.

A dozen dozen days
and we all remained silent. It preserved precious water
and stopped our rotting teeth from singing to us
in spots of reds and yellows and purples zip-zapping our brains
with promises of what our people are, and were, and will be.

We passed a mountain. Freshwater rose alone there,
climbing the steps on footed roots. We went thirsty for a day,
and when he returned, the instructions began.

VI.
the god in our teeth
is an angry god
  said joshua

VII.
i am not your god
  Freshwater replied.
i am again Gargantuan
and you are my new body

i am friend to the desert,
  said Freshwater,
the desert grants me leave
to extend your time imprisoned.

it's cool
guys
we got
this
  Moses said, and we were subsumed.

VIII.
We became Freshwater.

Our body together was his new body,
and in our flesh he walked on, mile after mile.

Freshwater's pain dulled its dissolution across bodies,
and with pain's removal, by inches, he settled into a renewed skin.

He sang like thunder.
He shouted great enactments, dozens of voices playing each part.

He strolled, he skipped, he stopped for days to reflect upon perfect rocks
in the perfect sand. He considered the stars and their patterns
and movements, and theorized on the nature of these bodies above.

Some of us became living books. He had them chant
until syllables turned to muscle memory
so he wouldn't forget thoughts while he turned to other matters.

He developed a passion for mathmatics.
He reasoned on the limits of objects in motion,
performed soliloquies for himself in the frozen nights,
and cried for mercy against the harshness of the sun.

IX.
One day, some years later,
when the root of the tooth stretched each israelite in its harness,
a body slung close to the center named itself Moses.

i think
i've had enough
of this god damn
tooth
  said Moses,
and wrenched his limbs free.

Moses seized the root bound to his neck,
wrestled it off, held it to the ground,
stepped up his leg, and, snap!
the needles in seventeen of his nerves
were severed forever from Freshwater.

Moses held the broken root and watched it turn into a rod. He remembered.
He began to strike. He circled the tooth and aimed for weak points and
his mouth filled with ash and his face stayed methodical

and it took two and a half hours.

Freshwater watched, bemused.
He had been alone in our bodies for so long,
He had forgotten that sometimes others can wish you harm.

Then the tooth cracked,
and as one me and aaron and joshua descended upon Moses.

Moses kept hitting the tooth, shoving and biting,
and as we torn him from his rod he gave out a cry.

Then the rod turned into a man.

The man sprang up, faced us, and gave a funny little smile.
He gave a small bow,
tapped on the enamel, and fell to splinters as the tooth split in two.

With a roar, the tooth shattered,
and each root-harness burst to water.
We found ourselves all in the middle of an oasis,
and each of us tried to remember how to swim.

Those who succeeded made it to shore,
and looked across the fresh water with blank eyes and distant dreams.

chill
  said Moses
I told you
we got this.
