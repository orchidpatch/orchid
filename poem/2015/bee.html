    <p>
        dad i have something to tell you, my daughter said to me, and i braced myself
        for the coming-out conversation, having expected the eventuality since she was
        eight or nine, dad, she said, dad i am a hive of bees dad, she said, and i
        looked at those eyes that were both her mother’s and not her mother’s, and i
        said daughter i don’t understand, is this a joke? and she said dad, there’s
        nothing to understand, it is just the way i am, and i am a hive of bees. i
        laughed and when her eyes didn’t change i got mad. i get it, i said to her,
        it’s hard to talk about being gay, you don’t have to hide it with this stupid
        story, and she said, who i am is not stupid. then i saw something move beneath
        her eyes, and the flicker of wings in her pupils, and, i said, no matter what —
    </p>
    <pre>
        a glamour flicks off…
        there are eyes and then
        six bees replace them
    </pre>
    <p>
        i stopped saying anything but screams because, lo and behold, she was just bees
        now. how i hadn’t seen this before i don’t know. her body that i no longer
        could see as human spread out through the room and maybe it could still speak
        but i couldn’t. i guess now i know what kind of father i am because i just
        started bellowing and swatting around. thinking back, looks like they never
        stung me until i started hitting them, squishing them in my fists. when i came
        to my senses she was gone.
    </p>
    <pre>
        through the window
        October light slants through the blinds
        seventeen husks on the floor
    </pre>
    <p>
        i regretted the outburst immediately but had nightmares for weeks. her mother
        and i taking walks and then i’d be stuck in some web and bees would crawl over
        me, turning me to honey and mulch. i’d try to talk back but i don’t know how to
        dance let alone dance like how bees talk to each other.
    </p>
    <pre>
        how do you send a letter
        to a runaway?
        another weekend snowstorm
    </pre>
    <p>
        she weeks turned to months and foot after foot dumped down on me. i kept tabs
        on the credit cards she stole and bought a beekeeper’s mask and hoped not
        closing the cards was enough of a signal i was sorry but maybe not because she
        didn’t come back. what kind of love can bees expect from the world?
    </p>
    <pre>
        winter into spring in increments
        what kind of love can bees expect?
        are flowers alone enough?
    </pre>
    <p>
        nightmares turned into memory-dreams: her gold hair like her mother’s and how
        she would scream at the moon at night when i walked with her in my arms when
        she couldn’t sleep and how she’d insist on feeding herself soon as she could
        gesture for herself and i turned the yard into one enormous garden, as many
        flowers as i can fit, just in case that’s what she’s waiting for to come home.
        i’m sorry, i want the flowers to say, i’m sorry, i’m sorry, i’m sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
        May. she returns.<br />
        it’s ok dad, she says, i’m me now.<br />
        some bees follow me inside, and hover over the couch;
        grab the remote like they’re a hand, and we watch tv until we fall asleep.
    </p>
