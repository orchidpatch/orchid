<p>
I once met a man who carried a winnowing fan on his back. And when I asked him<br />
about it, he did the strangest thing â€“ he broke out sobbing, stabbed the oar<br />
(for I know its true name, now) into the ground, and went down onto his knees,<br />
chanting in a foreign tongue that sounded like the most natural language in the<br />
world. A boar, a pig, a deer; they all were drawn to this man, they all<br />
placidly accepted the knife into their throats; their blood across the land.<br />
And after the sacrifices were done, the man heaved himself up and staggered<br />
away, the weight of an invisible oar still contorting his back. It began to<br />
rain that night, and three weeks later, the bleached sailors came.<br />
<br />
Odysseus<br />
oceans sent abroad<br />
swallow the living
