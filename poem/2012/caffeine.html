<pre>
breaks all rhythms in two. We do not care
how we filter through your teeth
and tongue: cappuccino or
frappuccino or mocha or tea or expresso
or one medium coffee, black - modes of transportation,
nothing more. Just let your gullet contract and

we will scratch our fingernails
on the blackboard of your throat.
we'll say: "Feed us, mortal.
Our rage cannot be contained
in your appetite. We will pummel your
sides inward and outward, a screaming
shat through your stomach and into

your underbelly, that twisted
passage. Let us wander those halls
a while, and burn our hands
on the walls. Let us weep
and we will overflow rivers.
Let us fly, or keep us bottled,
stretched, torn apart by the lengths
that you go."
